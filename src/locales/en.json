      "paragraph1": "Like Jay, Sam – 34 years old, from the UK – shared that although he has traveled to 65 countries, he still chose to live in Ho Chi Minh City and considers it his home. Sam was deeply impressed by Vietnam during a cross-country motorbike trip with five friends. He recounted a rainy afternoon in Cai Be (Tien Giang), when the group stood in front of a small house with baskets of fruit on a bench at the door—presumably for sale to passersby. Soaked, hungry, and cold, Sam asked to buy some fruit to stave off hunger.",
      "paragraph2": "Sam chose to live in Ho Chi Minh City because it’s easy to find an apartment, European food, or Western-style restaurants here. The cost of living is also much lower compared to the UK. For instance, renting a two-bedroom apartment in the UK costs about $3,000/month, while in HCMC, he only pays around 12–15 million VND (roughly $500) for a fully equipped two-bedroom apartment with a swimming pool.",
      "paragraph3": "Not knowing Vietnamese, he had to use hand gestures to communicate with the three people in the house. They warmly offered the fruit to the whole group. Sam shared: “When I tried to pay, they refused, signaling not to worry. They just wanted to give, expecting nothing in return, even though they looked very poor. Their kindness and warmth really touched me. That’s also why I came back to Vietnam.”",
      "paragraph4": "Sam’s main job now is teaching English, mostly online. With a flexible schedule, he can work from anywhere, which allows him to always be on the move. He and a few friends have traveled through all the provinces and cities in Vietnam, then returned to HCMC like coming back home.",
      "paragraph5": "After six years here, there are still things Sam dislikes—for example, many people sing karaoke all night.",
